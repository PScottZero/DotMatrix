After three years of inactivity, I decided to finally come back to working on this emulator. I am rewriting the code to be cleaner, and I will be continuing to fix bugs in the emulator code. I will also be implementing sound as well as Game Boy Color mode.

Certain games that never worked in the old emulation code now work! Some of these games include:
- Alleyway (had to properly implement serial interrupt)
- Super R.C. Pro-Am (had to correct lcd stat interrupt)

I've also added several new palettes, as well as a new splash screen.

## May 25th 2020
Added support for MBC5. Emulator now supports No-Bank, MBC1, MBC2, MBC3, and MBC5. Emulator now saves games properly as well. I have released an executable for this version (0.5 Beta) and plan to take a break from this project in order to work on other projects.
