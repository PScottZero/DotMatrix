# Project Status

At the moment, the CPU instruction set is mostly implemented. I am currently creating unit tests in order to make sure the CPU code is working properly.

# Notes

This emulator is written in C++ and uses the Qt library for its UI. I am using Visual Studio with the Qt Tools extension.
