# Dot Matrix: Project Status

## May 7th 2023
After three years of inactivity, I decided to finally come back to working on this emulator. I am rewriting the code to be cleaner, and I will be continuing to fix bugs in the emulator code. I will also be implementing sound as well as Game Boy Color mode.

Certain games that never worked in the old emulation code now work! Some of these games include:
- Alleyway (had to properly implement serial interrupt)
- Super R.C. Pro-Am (had to correct lcd stat interrupt)

I've also added several new palettes, as well as a new splash screen.

## May 25th 2020
Added support for MBC5. Emulator now supports No-Bank, MBC1, MBC2, MBC3, and MBC5. Emulator now saves games properly as well. I have released an executable for this version (0.5 Beta) and plan to take a break from this project in order to work on other projects.

Changed UI background and icon. Small revisions have also been made under the hood. Plan to finish implementing several banking methods next. Also, Pokemon is working (without save feature).
