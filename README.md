<p>Dr. Mario appears to be working. Joypad is now properly implemented. I still need to get 8x16 sprites working before Dr. Mario works perfectly.</p>

# About
This emulator is written in C++ and uses the Qt library for its UI. I am using CLion to write the code. Right now, I am working on finishing the video implementation. This project is probably about 80%, and I hope to get it finished soon!
